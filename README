GOMC - GPU Optimized Monte Carlo


BUILDING GOMC:

   Building GOMC requires cmake, available at http://www.cmake.org and in most
   Linux package repositories (as cmake)
   It's strongly recommended that you use a separate folder to build GOMC in.

   To build GOMC from the command line: 
   Navigate to your build folder in a terminal and do
      
      cmake PATH
      make

   where PATH is the path to the GOMC root folder (usually this folder)

   To build GOMC on Windows:
   Open the CMake-gui, set the Source Folder to the GOMC root folder, set the
   Build Folder to your Build Folder.
   Click configure, select your compiler/environment, wait for CMake to finish 
   configuration, Click configure again, and click generate.
   CMake will generate a project/solution etc. for your selected development
   environment in the build folder. Build GOMC as you would any other executable.

   (You can also use cmake from the Windows command line if you add it you your
   PATH environment variable.)

CONFIGURING CMAKE:
   CMake has a ridiculously expansive set of options, so this document will
   only reproduce the most obviously relevant ones.
   When possible, options should be passed into CMake via command line options
   rather than the CMake.txt file.

   SET BUILD MODE:

      -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=BuildType

      where BuildType is one of:
         None
         Debug
         Release (default)
         ReleaseWithDebInfo
         MinSizeRel


   SET ENSEMBLES:

      -DENSEMBLE_GEMC=Switch
      -DENSEMBLE_NVT=Switch

      where Switch is On or Off.
      CMake will prepare build rules for all ensmbles that are On.


   SET COMPILER:

      -DCMAKE_CXX_COMPILER=Compiler

      where Compiler is a valid compiler name or full path. If this is 
      omitted, CMake will select your default C++ compiler (usually gcc)
